# Introduction and Description
st.markdown("""
Tired of merging your tables using Excel and other programming tools, where you have to remember functions? There should be a simple tool with a few clicks to help you merge tables hassle-free. And here it is! MergeMaster allows you to merge your tables (maximum 5) using a column that you assign as a key column. Not just that, you can do other simple operations before merging such as visualizing your input tables, splitting the column using a separator, visualizing your output table, and downloading it in just a few seconds.
